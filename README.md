Mr. Teabag is a full-stack application designed for managing tea subscriptions. It allows users to:
  - View a list of all tea subscriptions.
  - Click on each subscription to see detailed information, including the subscription's name, price, and associated teas and customers.
  - Cancel a specific subscription if needed.

# App Overview

- Mr.Teabag logo: Positioned on the left side of the navbar.
- Title: Centrally placed to indicate the name of the app.
- Sort Button: Located on the right side of the navbar, allowing users to sort subscriptions by title alphabetically.

Each tea subscription in the list is clickable. Upon clicking a subscription, the user is taken to the detailed page for that particular tea subscription. On the details page, users can:
